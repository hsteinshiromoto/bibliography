Relaxed and hybridized backstepping
Humberto Stein Shiromoto‡, Vincent Andrieu⇤, Christophe Prieur‡
Abstract —In the present work, we consider nonlinear
control systems for which there exist structural obstacles to the design of classical continuous backstepping feedback laws. We conceive feedback laws such that the origin of the closed-loop system is not globally asymptotically stable but a suitable attractor (strictly containing the origin) is practically asymptotically stable. A design method is suggested to build a hybrid feedback law combining a backstepping controller with a locally stabilizing controller. A constructive approach is also suggested employing a di↵erential inclusion representation of the nonlinear dynamics. The results are illustrated for a nonlinear system which, due to its structure, does not have a priori any globally stabilizing backstepping controller.

controllers ([9] and [10]). In contrast to these works, for the class of systems considered in this paper,
a priori no continuous globally stabilizing controller does exist. Note that we address a di↵erent problem than [11], where a synergistic Lyapunov function and a feedback law are designed by backstepping.
In Section II, the stabilization problem under consideration is introduced, as well as the concepts on hybrid feedbacks and the set of assumptions. Based on this set of assumptions, a solution is given in Section III. In Section IV, su cient conditions are developped to verify the assumptions by using linear matrix inequalities. An illustration is given in Section V. Proofs of the results are presented in Section VI. Concluding remarks are given in Section VII.

Over the years, research in control of nonlinear dynam- Given a continuously di↵erentiable function f : Rn 1⇥R ! Rn,

ical systems has led to many di↵erent tools for the design of (globally) asymptotically stabilizing feedbacks. These techniques require particular structures on the systems. Depending on the assumptions, the designer may use di↵erent approaches such as high-gain [1], backstepping [2] or forwarding [3]. However, in the presence of unstructured dynamics, these classical design methods may fail.

For systems where the classical backstepping technique

can not be applied to render the origin globally asymp-

totically stable, the approach presented in this work may

solve the problem by utilizing a combination of a back-

stepping feedback law that renders a suitable compact set

globally attractive and a locally stabilizing controller. By

assumption, this set is contained in the basin of attraction

of the system in closed loop with the local controller. The

main contribution of this work can be seen as a design of

hybrid feedback laws for systems which

do not

a priori

have a controller that globally stabilizes the origin. This

methodology of hybrid stabilizers is by now well known [4]

and it has been also applied for systems that do not satisfy

the Brockett’s condition ([5] and [6]). Hybrid feedback

laws can have the advantage of rendering the equilibrium

of the closed-loop system robustly asymptotically stable

with respect to measurement noise and actuators’ errors

([7] and [8]). We also present a technique to design a

continuous local controller satisfying constraints on the

basin of attraction of the closed-loop system by using a

di↵erential inclusion.

To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work suggesting

a design method to adapt the backstepping technique to

a given local controller in the context of hybrid feedback

laws. Other works do exist in the context of continuous

II. Problem statement

A. Class of systems. In this work, we consider the class

nonlinear systems deﬁned by

⇢ x˙ 1 = f1(x1, x2) + h1(x1, x2, u) x˙ 2 = f2(x1, x2)u + h2(x1, x2, u),

(1)

where (x1, x2) 2 Rn 1 ⇥ R is the state and u 2 R is

the input. Functions f1, f2, h1 and h2 are locally Lips-

chitz continuous satisfying f1(0, 0) = 0, h1(0, 0, 0) = 0, h2(0, 0, 0) = 0 and, 8(x1, x2) 2 Rn 1 ⇥ R, f2(x1, x2) 6= 0. In a more compact notation, the vector (x1, x2) 2 Rn 1⇥R is denoted by x, the i-th component of x1 2 Rn 1 is

denoted

by

x1,i

and

system

(1)

is

denoted

by

x˙

=

f (x,
h

u).

When h1(x1, x2, u) ⌘ 0 and h2(x1, x2, u) ⌘ 0, system (1)

is denoted by x˙ = f (x, u).

Consider system x˙ = f (x, u), assuming stabilizability

of the x1-subsystem and applying backstepping, one may design a feedback law ' by solving an algebraic equation
b
in the input variable u. The solution of this algebraic equa-

tion equation renders the origin globally asymptotically

stable for x˙ = f (x, ' (x)) (e.g. [12]). However, because
b
functions h1 and h2 depend on u, the design of a feedback law for (1) leads to an implicit equation in this variable

(see (21) below for an example). Thus, backstepping may

be di cult (if not impossible) to apply for (1).

This is the motivation to introduce the hybrid feedback

of the origin, Equation (3) implies that the Lyapunov function Rn ⇥ Qˆ 3 (x, qˆ) 7! Vˆ(x) 2 R 0 is strictly

In order to have a term proportional to (x2 1(x1))2

hybrid feedback by applying Theorem 1.

VII. Conclusion
A design of hybrid feedback laws method has been presented in this paper to combine a backstepping controller with a local feedback law. This allows us to deﬁne a stabilizing control law for nonlinear control systems for which the backstepping design procedure can not be applied to globally stabilize the origin. We have also developed conditions to check the assumptions needed for the presented results. In a future work, the authors intend to use these techniques for other classes of nonlinear systems (e.g., cascade systems or in forwarding form).
