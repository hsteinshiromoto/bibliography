Abstract
For an ISS system, by analyzing local and non-local properties, it is obtained diﬀerent input-to-state gains. The interconnection of a system having two input-to-state gains with a system having a single ISS gain is analyzed. By employing the Small Gain Theorem for the local (resp. non-local) gains composition, it is concluded about the local (resp. global) stability of the origin (resp. of a compact set). Additionally, if the region of local stability of the origin strictly includes the region attraction of the compact set, then it is shown that the origin is globally asymptotically stable. An example illustrates the approach.
1 Introduction
The use of nonlinear input-output gains for the study of the stability of nonlinear was introduced in [22, 23] by considering a system as an input-output operator. The condition that ensures stability, called Small Gain Theorem, of the resulting interconnected system is based on the contraction principle ([23]).
The works [15] and [16] introduce a new concept of gain relating the input to system states. This notion of stability, called Input-to-State Stability (ISS), combines Zames and Lyapunov approaches ([18, 19]). Characterizations in terms of dissipation and Lyapunov functions are given in [20] and [21].
In [11], the contraction principle is used in the ISS notion to obtain an equivalent Small Gain Theorem. A formulation of this criteria in terms of Lyapunov functions may be found in [10] and [12].
Besides stability analysis, the Small Gain Theorem may also be used for the design of dynamic feedback laws satisfying robustness constraints. The interested reader may see [5, 6, 7] and [14] and references therein.

Other versions of the Small Gain theorem do exist in the literature, examples of which can be found in [3]. See also [2, 8] and [9] for the interconnection of possibly non-ISS systems.
In order to apply the Small Gain Theorem, it is required that the composition of the nonlinear gains is smaller than the argument for all of its positive values ([10, 12]). Such a condition, called Small Gain Condition, restricts the application of the Small Gain Theorem to a composition of well chosen gains.
In this work, it is made use of the Small Gain Theorem in a less conservative way. This new condition ensures the asymptotic stability of a system by showing that if there exist two diﬀerent gains compositions such that they satisfy the Small Gain Condition, not for all values of the arguments, but in two diﬀerent regions, and if these regions cover the set of all positive values, then the resulting interconnected system is globally asymptotically stable. Thus, this approach may be seen as a composition of two diﬀerent small gain conditions that hold in diﬀerent regions: a local and a global.
The use of a unifying approach is well known in the literature, see [1] for the combination of control Lyapunov functions and [4] for a stability concept uniting ISS and the integral variant of ISS (namely, iISS [17]) properties.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the basic concepts of Inputto-State Stability and the Dini derivative are presented. Also, the system under consideration, the problem statement and a motivational example are presented. In Section 3, the assumptions to solve the problem under consideration, as well as the main results are presented. Section 4 presents an example that illustrates the assumptions and main results. Section 5 contains the proofs of the main results. Concluding remarks are given in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, auxiliary results are stated. Due to space limitations, some of the proofs were omitted.

2 Background and problem statement

Consider the system

x˙ (t) = f (x(t), u(t)),

(1)

where, ∀t ∈ R≥0, x(t) ∈ Rn and u(t) ∈ Rm, for some positive integers n and m. The map f : Rn × Rm → Rn is assumed to be continuous, locally Lipschitz on x and uniformly in u on compact sets. A solution of (1) with initial condition

x, and input u at time t is denoted by X(t, x, u). Assume that the origin is an equilibrium point for the system (1), i.e., f (0, 0) = 0.
Deﬁnition 1. Consider the function ξ : [a, b) → R, the limit

D+ξ(t)

=

lim sup
τ ց0

ξ(t+τ )−ξ(t) τ

(if it exists) is called Dini derivative. Let k be a positive integer. Consider the functions ϕ : Rk → R and h : Rk → Rk, the limit

Dh+ϕ(y)

=

lim sup
τ ց0

ϕ(y+τ

h(y))−ϕ(y) τ

.

(if it exists) is called Dini derivative of ϕ in the h-direction at y.

•

Deﬁnition 2. A continuous locally Lipschitz function V : Rn → R is called an
ISS-Lyapunov function for system (1) if • there exist class K∞ functions α and α such that, ∀x ∈ Rn, α(|x|) ≤ V (x) ≤ α(|x|);
• there exist a class K function αx, called ISS gain, and a continuous positive deﬁnite function λx : Rn → R such that, ∀(x, u) ∈ Rn × Rm,

|x| ≥ αx(|u|) ⇒ Df+V (x, u) ≤ −λx(x)

(2)

holds.

•

From now on, V will be assumed to be an ISS-Lyapunov function for (1).

Consider the system

z˙(t) = g(v(t), z(t)),

(3)

where, ∀t ∈ R≥0, v(t) ∈ Rn and z(t) ∈ Rm, for some positive integers n and m. The map g : Rn × Rm → Rn is assumed to be continuous, locally Lipschitz on z and uniformly in v on compact sets. A solution of (3) with initial condition z, and input v at time t is denoted by Z(t, z, v). Assume that the origin is an equilibrium point for the system (3), i.e., g(0, 0) = 0. Consider also the following

Assumption 1. There exists a continuous locally Lipschitz function W : Rm →
R that is an ISS-Lyapunov function for the z-subsystem. More precisely, there exist class K∞ functions β and β satisfying, ∀z ∈ Rm, β(|z|) ≤ W (z) ≤ β(|z|). Furthermore, there exist a class K function δ and a continuous positive deﬁnite function λz : Rm → R such that, ∀(x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm,

W (z) ≥ δ(V (x)) ⇒ Dg+W (x, z) ≤ −λz(z),

(4)

where V is the ISS-Lyapunov function of x-subsystem.

System under consideration. Interconnecting systems (1) and (3) by

linking the state of (1) with the input of (3) and vice versa leads to the following

system

x˙ = f (x, z) z˙ = g(x, z).

(5)

Since f (0, 0) = 0 and g(0, 0) = 0, the origin is an equilibrium point for (5). Considering the ISS-Lyapunov inequalities, after the interconnection the following implications

V (x) ≥ γ(W (z)) ⇒ Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x), W (z) ≥ δ(V (x)) ⇒ Dg+W (x, z) ≤ −λz(z)

are obtained with suitable class K functions γ and δ. A suﬃcient condition that ensures stability of (5) is given by the following

Theorem 1. [10] If,

∀s ∈ R>0, γ ◦ δ(s) < s.

(6)

Then, the origin is globally asymptotically stable for (5).

Problem statement. At this point, it is possible to explain the problems that are dealt with, in this work. • ISS gains computation. Although the use of ISS gains renders the analysis of stability easy to work with, it is not a trivial task to compute those gains; • Small gain condition. Since the ISS gain is not unique, it might not be an easy task to ﬁnd two ISS gains: one for the x-subsystem of (5) and another for the z-subsystem of (5) such that their composition satisﬁes (6), for all positive values of the argument. An illustration of the problem that is dealt with is presented in the following
Example 1. Let the functions f, g : R × R → R and consider the system

x˙ = f (x, z) = −ρ(x) + z z˙ = g(x, z) = − sign(z)δ˜(|z|) + x,

(7)

where δ˜ will be deﬁned below. Let, ∀x ∈ R, V (x) = |x|, ρ(x) = 5x/4 − 2x2 + x3 and, ∀z ∈ R, W (z) = |z|.
Taking the Dini derivative of V in the f -direction, ∀(x, z) ∈ R × R, it yields

Df+V (x, z) ≤ −ρ(V (x)) + W (z).

(8)

This implies that ∃εx ∈ (0, 1) such that, ∀(x, z) ∈ R × R,

ρ(V

(x))

≥

W (z) 1−εx

⇒

Df+V

(x, z)

≤

−λx(x),

(9)

where λx(·) := εxρ(V (·)). From now on, let εx = 0.05. Note also that, in the interval [1/2, 5/6], ρ is decreasing.

Consider the piecewise continuous function Γ deﬁned by

Γ(s) =

where [5/6, ∞) ∋ s → ρ+(s) = ρ(s) ∈ [ρ(5/6), ∞).

Remark 1. The function Γ can be viewed as a discontinuous input-to-state

gain of the x-subsystem of (7). More preciselly, ∀(x, z) ∈ R × R, V (x) ≥ Γ(W (z)) ⇒ Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x). Furthermore, the function Γ is “optimal”, in the sense that if there exist a function Γ∗ : R → R and a value s∗ ∈ R>0 such that Γ∗(s∗) < Γ(s∗), then ∃(x∗, z∗) = (0, 0) such that V (x∗) ≥ Γ∗(W (z∗)) and

Df+V (x∗, z∗) > 0.

◦

It follows from Remark 1 that an ISS gain for the x-subsystem of (7) is any
class K function γ such that, ∀s ∈ R>0, Γ(s) ≤ γ(s). A local gain. Consider the function [0, 1/2) ∋ s → ρ−(s) = ρ(s) ∈ [0, ρ(1/2)). Since ρ− is strictly increasing on its domain, it is invertible. Let γℓ be a class K function such that, ∀s ∈ [0, 0.95ρ(1/2)),

γℓ(s) = ρ−−1

s 0.95

.

(11)

Note that, γℓ satisﬁes the following inequalities

γℓ(s) ≤ Γ(s), γℓ(s) < Γ(s).

Moreover, ∀(x, z) ∈ Ωρ(1/2)(V ) × R,

V (x) ≥ γℓ(W (z)) ⇒ Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x).

(12)

Let the constant values Mℓ = 0.236 and Mg = 0.245. At this point, it is possible to deﬁne the function δ˜ of the z-subsystem of (7). It is a function of class K∞ satisfying the following inequalities

∀s ∈ (0, Mℓ], γℓ(s) < δ˜(s),

(13)

∀s ∈ [Mg, ∞), Γ(s) < δ˜(s),

(14)

∀s ∈

δ˜(s) < Γ(s).

(15)

Equations (13) and (14) correspond to two diﬀerent small gain conditions, the

ﬁrst may be seen as a small gain condition for small values of the argument

while the last as a small gain condition for large values of the argument. Note

that (15) implies that Theorem 1 cannot be applied.1

Fig. 1 shows a plot of the functions ρ, id, Γ, γℓ and δ˜.

In this work, it will be shown that, if • there exist two ISS gains γℓ and γg, for the x-subsystem of (5); • there exists one ISS gain δ, for the z-subsystem of (5); • the compositions γℓ ◦ δ and γg ◦ δ satisfy the Small Gain Condition, not for all values of the arguments, but for two diﬀerent intervals (Iℓ, Ig ⊂ R≥0). In other words,
∀s ∈ Iℓ \ {0}, γℓ ◦ δ(s) < s and, ∀s ∈ Ig \ {0}, γg ◦ δ(s) < s;
• these intervals are such that Iℓ ∩ Ig = ∅ and Iℓ ∪ Ig = R≥0; then, the origin is globally asymptotically stable for (5). See Theorem 2 below for a precise statement of this result.

4 Illustration
Example 2. [Example 1 revisited.] Verifying Assumption 1. Let the function δ be given by the inverse of δ˜. It follows that, ∀(x, z) ∈ R × R, W (z) ≥ δ(V (x)) ⇒ Dg+W (z) ≤ −λz(z), where for a given εz ∈ (0, 1) and ∀z ∈ R, λz(z) = εzW (z). Thus, Assumption 1 holds. Verifying Assumption 2.

5 Proofs
5.1 Proof of Proposition 1
Proof. This proof is divided into three parts. In the ﬁrst one, it is obtained a function σℓ that is class K∞ and C1 with strictly positive derivative. This function is used in the second part, where a class C0 proper positive deﬁnite function Uℓ is deﬁned and its Dini derivative is studied. In the last part, it is shown that Uℓ is locally Lipschitz and the local asymptotical stability of the origin is concluded by using Lemma 2.
First part. Consider the class K functions δ and γℓ from Assumptions 1 and 2. Under Assumption 3, δ and γℓ are such that, ∀s ∈ (0, Mℓ], δ(s) < γℓ−1(s).

Since γℓ is class of K, from Lemma 1, there exists a class K∞ function γ˜ℓ

such that, ∀s ∈ R>0,

δ(s) < γ˜ℓ(s)

(22)

and, ∀s ∈ (0, Mℓ],

γ˜ℓ(s) < γℓ−1(s).

(23)

Since δ is of class K and γ˜ℓ is of class K∞ satisfying, ∀s ∈ R>0, inequality (22), from Lemma [10, Lemma A.1], there exists a class K∞ and C1 function σℓ whose derivative is strictly positive and satisﬁes, ∀s ∈ R>0,

δ(s) < σℓ(s) < γ˜ℓ(s).

(24)

Second part. Let, ∀(x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm, Uℓ(x, z) := max{σℓ(V (x)), W (z)}. Note that the function Uℓ is proper positive deﬁnite. Pick (x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm,

one of three cases is possible: σℓ(V (x)) < W (z), W (z) < σℓ(V (x)) or W (z) =
σℓ(V (x)). The proof follows by showing that the Dini derivative of Uℓ is negative. For each case, assume that (x, z) ∈ ΩMℓ (V ) × Rm.
Case 1. Suppose that σℓ(V (x)) < W (z). This implies that Uℓ(x, z) = W (z) and Df+,gUℓ(x, z) = Dg+W (x, z).
From (24), the following inequality δ(V (x)) < σℓ(V (x)) < W (z) holds. Together with (4), it follows that Dg+W (x, z) ≤ −λz(z). This concludes Case 1.

Case 2. Suppose that W (z) < σℓ(V (x)). This implies that Uℓ(x, z) = σℓ(V (x)) and Df+,gUℓ(x, z) = σℓ′ (V (x))Df+V (x, z). From (24), the following inequality W (z) < σℓ(V (x)) < γ˜ℓ(V (x)) holds. Since V (x) ≤ Mℓ, it follows that

W (z) < σℓ(V (x)) < γ˜ℓ(V (x)) < γℓ−1(V (x)),

(25)

where the last inequality follows from (23). Equation (17) together with (25) yields Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x).
Since, ∀s ∈ R>0, σℓ′ (s) > 0, it follows that Df+,gUℓ(x, z) = σℓ′ (V (x))Df+V (x, z) ≤ −σℓ′ (V (x))λx(x). This concludes Case 2.
Case 3. Let W (z) = σℓ(V (x)) := Uℓ∗(x, z). This implies

The analysis of Df+,gUℓ∗ is divided in two sub cases. In the ﬁrst one, the function Dg+W is analyzed while in the last, the function Df+V is analyzed.
Case 3.a. The analysis of Dg+W . From (24), the following inequality δ(V (x)) < σℓ(V (x)) = W (z) holds. Together with Equation (4), it yields Dg+W (x, z) ≤ −λz (z ).

Case 3.b. The analysis of Df+V . From (24), the following inequality W (z) = σℓ(V (x)) < γ˜ℓ(V (x)) holds. Since V (x) ≤ Mℓ, it follows that

W (z) = σℓ(V (x)) < γ˜ℓ(V (x)) < γℓ−1(V (x)),

(26)

where the last inequality is due to (23). Equation (17) together with (26) yields Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x). To conclude Case 3, W (z) = σℓ(V (x)) ⇒ Df+,gUℓ∗(x, z) ≤ − min{σℓ′ (V (x))λx(x), λz(z)}
holds, since (x, z) ∈ ΩMℓ (V ) × Rm. Let M˜ ℓ := max{c ∈ R>0 : Ωc(Uℓ) ⊂ ΩMℓ (V )×{0} and Ωc(Uℓ) is connected}.
To sum up all the above cases, ∀(x, z) ∈ ΩM˜ℓ (Uℓ),

Uℓ(x, z) ≤ M˜ ℓ ⇒ Df+,gUℓ(x, z) ≤ −Eℓ(x, z),

(27)

where E(·, ·) := min{σℓ′ (V (·))λx(·), λz(·)} is continuous and positive deﬁnite. Third part. To conclude local asymptotical stability of the origin, it re-
mains to show that Uℓ is locally Lipschitz. Since σℓ(V (·)) (resp. W ) is locally Lipschitz, Uℓ is locally Lipschitz in the region W (·) ≤ σℓ(V (·)) (resp. σℓ(V (·)) ≤ W (·)). Since the hypotheses of Lemma 2 (in Section 7) below are veriﬁed with U (·) = Uℓ(·) and E(·) = Eℓ(·), the origin is locally asymptotically stable for (5). This concludes the proof of Proposition 1.

5.2 Proof of Proposition 2

Proof. This proof is analogous to the proof of Proposition 1 and divided into

three parts. In the ﬁrst one, it is obtained a function σg that is class K∞ and C1 with strictly positive derivative. This function is used in the second part,

where a class C0 proper and positive deﬁnite function Ug is deﬁned and its Dini

derivative is studied. In the last part, it is used Lemma 4 to show that the set

ΩMg (V ) × {0} is globally asymptotically stable.

First part. Consider the class K functions δ and γg from Assumptions 1

and 4. The function γg−1 is deﬁned on [0, bg) and satisﬁes limsրbg γg−1(s) = ∞. Assumption 5 implies that, ∀s ∈ [Mg, bg), δ(s) < γg−1(s). Since γg is of class

K, from Lemma 1 (in Section 7), there exists a class K∞ function γ˜g such that,

∀s ∈ R>0,

δ(s) < γ˜g(s)

(28)

and, ∀s ∈ [Mg, bg),

γ˜g(s) < γg−1(s).

(29)

Since δ is of class K and γ˜g is of class K∞ satisfying, ∀s ∈ R>0, the inequality (28), from Lemma [10, Lemma A.1], there exists a function σg that is of class K∞ and C1 whose derivative is strictly positive and satisﬁes, ∀s ∈ R>0,

δ(s) < σg(s) < γ˜g(s).

(30)

Second part. Let, ∀(x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm, Ug(x, z) := max{σg(V (x)), W (z)}. Note that the function Ug is proper positive deﬁnite. Pick (x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm, one of three cases is possible: σg(V (x)) < W (z), W (z) < σg(V (x)) or W (z) =

σg(V (x)). The proof follows by showing that the Dini derivative of Ug is negative. For each case, assume that (x, z) ∈ (Rn \ ΩMg (V )) × Rm.
Case 1. Suppose that σg(V (x)) < W (z). Analogously to the Case 1 of proof of Proposition 1, σg(V (x)) < W (z) ⇒ Df+,gUg(x, z) ≤ −λz(z). This concludes Case 1.

Case 2. Suppose that W (z) < σg(V (x)). This implies that Ug(x, z) = σg(V (x)) and Df+,gUg(x, z) = σg′ (V (x))Df+V (x, z). From (30), the following inequality

W (z) < σg(V (x)) < γ˜g(V (x))

(31)

holds. At this point, two regions of x will be analyzed: bg ≤ V (x) and Mg ≤ V (x) < bg.
Case 2.a. In the region where bg ≤ V (x), Equation (20) together with (19) yields Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x).
Case 2.b. In the region where Mg ≤ V (x) < bg, from (29) and (31), it yields

W (z) < σg(V (x)) < γ˜g(V (x)) < γg−1(V (x)).

(32)

Equation (20) together with (32) yields Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x). Since, ∀s ∈ R>0, σg′ (s) > 0, it follows that Df+,gUg(x, z) = σg′ (V (x))Df+V (x, z) ≤
−σg′ (s)λx(x). This concludes Case 2. Case 3. Let W (z) = σg(V (x)) := Ug∗(x, z). Analogously to the Case 3 of
proof Proposition 1 and together with the analysis of Cases 1 and 2, the implication W (z) = σg(V (x)) ⇒ Df+,gUg(x, z) ≤ − min{σg′ (s)λx(x), λz(z)} holds, since (x, z) ∈ (Rn \ ΩMg (V )) × Rm.
Let M˜ g = min{c ∈ R>0 : ΩMg (V ) × {0} ⊂ Ωc(Ug) and Ωc(Ug) is connected}.
To sum up all the above cases, ∀(x, z) ∈ (Rn × Rm) \ ΩM˜g (Ug),

M˜ g < Ug(x, z) ⇒ Df+,gUg(x, z) ≤ −Eg(x, z),

(33)

where Eg(·, ·) = min{σg′ (V (·))λx(·), λz(·)} is continuous and positive deﬁnite. Third part. Analogously to the third part of the proof of Proposition 1, it
follows that Ug is locally Lipschitz. From Lemma 3 and (33), it follows that, ∀(x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm and ∀t ∈ R≥0, along solutions of (5),

D+Ug(X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x))=Df+,gUg(X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x)).

Since solutions of (5) are absolutely continuous functions and, along solutions of (5), Eg is a continuous positive deﬁnite function, from Lemma 4, ∀(x, z) ∈ (Rn × Rm) \ ΩM˜g (Ug) and ∀t ∈ R≥0, the function

t → Ug(X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x))

(34)

is strictly decreasing. Pick (x, z) ∈ (Rn × Rm) \ ΩM˜g (Ug), it will be proven that

Ug∞

:=

lim
t→∞

Ug (X (t,

x,

z),

Z (t,

x))

M˜ g.

To see the above suppose, by contradiction, that Ug∞ > M˜ g. From the continuity of Ug, ∃ε > 0 such that Ug∞ −ε > M˜ g and Ug∞ −ε ≤ Ug(x, z) ≤ Ug∞ +ε. Since Ug is proper, the constant ξ = min{Eg(x, z) > 0 : (x, z) ∈ Ug(x, z) and Ug∞ − ε ≤ Ug(x, z) ≤ Ug∞ + ε} exists. Recalling the deﬁnition of Ug, ∃T > 0 such that, ∀t ≥ T , Ug(X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x)) − Ug∞ < ε. Moreover, from the deﬁnition of the constant ξ,

Then,

Ug(X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x)) − Ug(X(T, x, z), Z(T, z, x)) =

which contradicts the fact that Ug is positive deﬁnite. Therefore, Ug∞ ≤ M˜ ℓ. In summary, the following facts hold for the function Ug: 1) Ug is a proper
positive deﬁnite function; 2) Ug decreases along solutions of (5) having initial conditions in (Rn × Rm) \ ΩM˜g (Ug). From facts 1) and 2), the set ΩM˜g (Ug) is globally asymptotically stable for (5). This concludes the proof of Proposition
2.

5.3 Proof of Theorem 2

Proof. Under Assumption 6, ∃M > 0 such that Mg < M < Mℓ. Under Assumptions 1, 2, 3 and Proposition 1, it follows that the origin is locally asymp-
totically stable. From the proof of Proposition 1, there exists a proper positive deﬁnite function given, ∀(x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm, by Uℓ(x, z) = max{σℓ(V (x), W (z)}, where σℓ is of class K∞ and C1 satisfying (24). Moreover, letting Mˆ ℓ := max{c ∈ R>0 : c > M, Ωc(Uℓ) ⊂ ΩMℓ (V ) × {0} with Ωc(Uℓ) connected} every solution
starting in ΩMˆℓ (Uℓ) converges to the origin. Together with Assumptions 1, 4, 5 and the proof of Proposition 2, it is
possible to deﬁne, ∀s ∈ R≥0, a class K∞ function γˆg(s) = min{γ˜g(s), σℓ(s)} satisfying (28) and (29). Then, it is obtained a class K∞ and C1 function σˆg whose derivative is strictly positive and satisﬁes, ∀s ∈ R>0,

δ(s) < σˆg(s) < γˆg(s).

(30.new)

Deﬁning a proper positive deﬁnite function given, ∀(x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm, by Uˆg(x, z) = max{σˆg(V (x)), W (z)} and the constant Mˆ g = min{c ∈ R>0 : c < M, ΩMg (V ) × {0} ⊂ Ωc(Uˆg) with Ωc(Uˆg) connected}, it follows from the proof of Proposition 2 that the set ΩMˆg (Uˆg) is globally asymptotically stable.
Since, ∀s ∈ R>0, σˆg(s) < σℓ(s), it follows that, ∀(x, z) ∈ (Rn ×Rm)\{(0, 0)}, Uˆg(x, z) < Uℓ(x, z). This inequality implies that, ∀c ∈ R>0, Ωc(Uˆg) ⊂ Ωc(Uℓ). Then, the following inclusion holds

ΩMˆg (Uˆg) ⊂ ΩM (Uˆg) ⊂ ΩM (Uℓ) ⊂ ΩMˆℓ (Uℓ).

(35)

Thus, every solution of (5) starting in (Rn × Rm) \ ΩMˆℓ (Uℓ) converges to ΩMˆg (Uˆg), in ﬁnite time. Then, due to (35), ΩMˆg (Uˆg) ⊂ ΩMˆℓ (Uℓ) holds, and thus solutions will converge to the origin, as t → ∞.
From the above, combining the local asymptotical stability of the origin with
its global attractivitty it is concluded that the origin is globally asymptotically
stable for (5).

6 Conclusion and perspectives
In this work, the authors shown that it is possible to make use of local and nonlocal input-to-state properties of an ISS system, in order to derive an “optimal” ISS gain. As a result of such approach, it is possible to apply the Small Gain Theorem in a less conservative way by deriving local and non-local small gain conditions to ensure the stability of an interconnected system.
In a future work, the authors will generalize the above results for the case in which there exist four ISS gains: two for each subsystem. Moreover, the authors also intend to use the region-dependent gain condition to develop a methodology for the design of feedback laws under diﬀerent gains constraints.

Due to space constraints, the proof of Lemma 1 is not provided in this paper.
Lemma 2. [13, Th´eor`eme 2.133] Let S ⊂ Rk be a be a neighborhood of the origin. Let also the class C0 function h : Rk → Rk and consider the system y˙ = h(y). If there exist a positive deﬁnite and locally Lipschitz function U : S → R and a positive deﬁnite function E : S → R such that, ∀y ∈ S, Dh+U (y) ≤ −E(y). Then, the origin is locally asymptotically stable for y˙ = h(y).

Lemma 3. [13, Lemme 1.28] Let the measurable and essentially bounded function d : R → Rp and the class C0 function h : Rk × Rp → Rk. If U : Rk → R
is locally Lipschitz, then, for all maximal solutions Y (t, y, d) of the system
y˙ = h(y, d(t)) deﬁned in the interval (t−, t+), the function t → U (Y (t, y, d)), deﬁned over (t−, t+), is locally Lipschitz and, for almost every t ∈ (t−, t+),

Lemma 4. Let Y : R → Rk be an absolutely continuous function, U : Rk → R be a locally Lipschitz proper positive deﬁnite function and E : Rk → R be a continuous positive deﬁnite function. Deﬁne, ∀t ∈ R, U (t) = U ◦ Y (t) and E(t) = E ◦ Y (t). If, ∀t ∈ R, D+U (t) ≤ −E(t), then, ∀t ∈ R, U (t) is strictly decreasing.
Due to space constraints, the proof of Lemma 4 is not provided in this paper.
