Abstract—This work provides an example that motivates and illustrates theoretical results related to a combination of small-gain and density propagation conditions. Namely, in case the small-gain fails to hold at certain points or intervals the density propagation condition can be applied to assure global stability properties. We repeat the theoretical results here and demonstrate how they can be applied in the proposed example.

I. INTRODUCTION
Here we will consider two nonlinear interconnected systems, each of them is ISS, and ask whether the interconnection is ISS as well. Typically one uses the so-called small-gain condition to assure this property. However in case this condition fails to hold at several points or intervals further conditions to assure global stability properties are necessary. This condition can be written in terms of a density propagation inequality [1]. Moreover if one tries to verify the small-gain condition numerically it can easily happen that this condition fails due to the unprecise computer calculations. Also in this case the density propagation condition can help to ﬁll such gaps.
The example considered below demonstrates this kind of situations and illustrates how a combination of small-gain and density propagation conditions can be applied. First we recall the related theoretical results, that will be published elsewhere, then we will consider the example in detail.
II. PRELIMINARIES AND NOTATION
The notation N (resp. R) stands for the set N Y t8u (resp. R Y t8u). For a given a, b P R let Nra,bs “ ts P N : a ď s ď bu. Let S Ă Rn, its closure (resp. interior) is denoted as cltSu (resp. inttSu). We recall the following standard deﬁnitions: a function α : r0, 8q Ñ r0, 8q is of class K when α is continuous, strictly increasing, and αp0q “ 0. If α is also unbounded, then we say it is of class K8. A continuous function β : r0, 8q ˆ r0, 8q Ñ r0, 8q is of class KL, when

with the state x “ px1, x2q P Rn, n “ n1 ` n2, dynamics f “ pf1, f2q and input u “ pu1, u2q P Rm, m “ m1 ` m2.
Deﬁnition 1 ([2]). The system (2) is called input-to-state stable (ISS) if there exist functions β P KL and γ˜u P K8 such that, for each initial condition xp0q and each measurable essentially bounded input up¨q, the solution xp¨q of (2) satisﬁes

|xptq| ďβp|xp0q|, tq ` γ˜up|u|8q @t ě 0.

ISS is equivalent to the existence of an ISS-Lyapunov function, which we deﬁne for each subsystem in (1):

Deﬁnition 2. A function Vi P LiplocpRni , Rě0q is called storage function if for some αi, αi P K8 it holds that αip|xi|q ď Vipxiq ď αip|xi|q @xi P Rni .

Deﬁnition 3. A storage function Vi is called ISS-Lyapunov function for (1) if for some γi,j, γi, αi P K8 the implication

(3b)

holds for each xi P Rni , xj P Rnj , and ui P Rmi . γi,j (resp. γi) is called interconnecting (resp. external) ISS-Lyapunov gain.

Stability of the resulting interconnected system (2) can be deduced from the small-gain theorem [3]: if the interconnecting ISS-Lyapunov gains satisfy

γ12 ˝ γ21psq ă s @s ą 0,

(4)

then system (2) is input-to-state stable.

In this paper we assume that the graphs of γ1´21 and γ21 have several points of intersection. It means that small-gain condition does not hold globally and the previously known results cannot be utilized to verify global stability properties of the interconnection. To guarantee the desired stability properties of the interconnection, the dual to Lyapunov’s techniques [1, 4] is employed in speciﬁc domains of the state space. Our approach extends the results of [5] to the case of arbitrary number of intersection points of γ1´21 and γ21 and allows for external inputs. Moreover our stability conditions are less restrictive then in [5].

Assumption 1. Let for each i “ 1, 2 there exist an ISSLyapunov function Vi for Σi from (1) with the corresponding gain functions γi,j, γi P K8, and αi P K8.
Assumption 2. Let the intersection points of the graphs of γ1´21 and γ21 be given. These points deﬁne a sequence of intervals Mk “ pM k, M kq where the small-gain condition (4) holds for any s P Mk, k P Nr1, s, P N.
For a given δ P Rě0 let Lipδq “ txi P Rni : Vipxiq ď δu.
Theorem 4. Let Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Then there exists γ P K8 such that almost all solutions to system (2) starting in the set Bk converge to a neighborhood of the set Ak with radius γp|u|8q, where
Ak “ tx P Rn : x1 P L1pmaxtM k, γ12pM kquq, (5) x2 P L2pmaxtγ21pM kq, γ21 ˝ γ21pM kququ,
Bk “ tx P Rn : x1 P L1pM kq, x2 P L2pγ21pM kqqu. (6)

If M ‰ 8 then the above mentioned convergence holds only for some bounded inputs u.

The input-to-state stability of system (2) follows trivially when “ 1, M 1 “ 0, M 1 “ 8; then A1 “ t0u and B1 “ R2. However, when ą 1, solutions to (2) starting in the set Ak may converge to an ω-limit set [6, Birkhoff’s Theorem] that lies inside the set Ak and do not converge to a ball centred at the origin whose radius is proportional to the norm of the
input. Due to this fact, the next assumption is needed to check the asymptotic behaviour of solutions inside the sets Ak. Let B0 “ H and A `1 “ Rn.
Assumption 3. Let for each k P Nr1, `1s, there exist an open set Dk Ă Rn satisfying tAkzBk´1u Ĺ cltDku and
‚ A differentiable function ρk : Dk Ñ Rą0; ‚ A continuous function qk : Dk Ñ Rě0 such that, for
almost every x P Dk, qkpxq ą 0; ‚ A function γk P K such that, for every x P Dk and for
every u P Rm, the following implication holds

This is denoted as roundptanhprq ´ 1q “ 0. The values where r satisﬁes the equation roundptanhprq´1q “ 0 are said to be regions where g is numerically constant.

For values of a that are big enough (even inﬁnite), due to numerical imprecision, the system resulting from the composition of (9) shows the presence of (possibliy inﬁnitely) pn`1q equilibrium points. These points are the maxima of the function h, namely, the points rk “ 2π2k ` π2, where k P Z.
Figures 2 and 3 show a simulation of the system resulting interconnected system composed of (9) without inputs and with nonzero inputs, respectively.
Note that the method presented in [5] can be employed to deduce the stability of the interconnected system, when the inputs are identically zero and n “ 0. However, when this is not the case, the method presented in this paper is needed.
In the next paragraphs, the analysis is divided into two regions, according to whether the function g is numerically constant or not.

A. Proof that system (9) is ISS

To see that system (9) is ISS, for each index i “ 1, 2, deﬁne for every xi P R, the function Vipxiq “ |xi|. The time derivative of this function along solutions to (9), for every

px3´i, uiq P R ˆ R, the following inequality

(11)

From here, two cases are analyzed, according to n be ﬁnite or not.
Let n be ﬁnite. Since the function |g| positive deﬁnite, there exist functions αi, αi,u P K such that, for every xi P R, the inequality

V9ipxiq ď ´αipVipxiqq ` 25hpV3´ipx3´iqq ` αi,up|ui|q, (12)

holds, for every pxi, x3´i, uiq P R ˆ R ˆ R. Thus, system (9) is ISS. Hence, Assumption 1 holds.

B. Proof that it satisﬁes small-gain conditions in the region where g is not numerically constant

Assume that n is ﬁnite. This implies that there exists n ` 2 regions where the function Rě0 Q r ÞÑ gprq is not numerically constant. These regions are intervals pM k, M kq of Rě0 where the function g is strictly numerically increasing, i.e., given
two values r1, r2 P pM k, M kq with r1 ă r2, roundp|gpr1q ´ gpr2qq| ‰ 0 and gpr1q ă gpr2q. Consequently, g is invertible on these intervals.
Fix δ P p0, 1q and let |ui|8 “ 0. Since id ă |g|, where id is the identity function, together with (11), the condition

implies

Also, for every xi P pM k, M kq, the inequality

γi ˝ γ3´ipVipxiqq ă Vipxiq

When n is inﬁnite, the same analysis of item is employed. However, there are (countably many) intervals pM k, M kq. Thus, the small-gain condition holds, for the system resulting of the interconnection of (9) with |u|8 “ 0. Thus, Assumption 2 holds.

C. Proof that it satisﬁes the dissipation inequality in the regions where g is numerically constant

The regions where g is numerically constant correspond to

the closed set

ď Rz pM k, M kq.

k

For every xi in this set, roundp1 ´ tanhpxiqq “ 0. Since g is numerically constant, its derivative is zero. Consequently, the divergence of the vector ﬁeld describing the differential equation (9) is numerically constant and equals to zero, because it is the derivative of g.

From the continuity of the functions, there exists ε ą 0 such that, for every x1 and x2 P p´ε, εq, the inequality divpρf qpxq ď 0 holds. Using the same reasoning, and due to the “periodicity” of the vector ﬁeld f , the same conclusion can be obtained for every region where g is not numerically constant.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
In this paper, the interconnection of two ISS system for which a single small-gain condition does not hold everywhere on the positive real semi-axis has been considered.
Under the assumption that there are (inﬁnitely many) regions where the small-gain condition hold and, outside the union of these regions, the density propagation condition holds, the trajectories of solutions to the interconnected systems that do not converge to the origin have Lebesgue measure zero. An example illustrates the proposed approach.
In a future work, the authors intend to generalize the methods for the interconnection of n ą 2 ISS systems.

When n is inﬁnite or |u1|8 “ |u2|8 “ 0, the function divpρf q is positive almost for almost every xi in the region where g is numerically constant.
Since the above inequalities are strict and hold in a closed set, there exist a suitable open set Dk and a function qk : Dk Ñ Rě0 satisfying Assumption 3.
Therefore, from Theorem 6, system resulting from the interconnection of system (9) is almost input-to-state stable.
Consider the region where g is not numerically constant. In this region, there exists a subset where divpρf q ď 0. To see this claim, without loss of generality let |u1|8 “ |u2|8 “ 0, and note that ρp0q div pf qp0q “ ´25g1p0q “ ´50 sech2
