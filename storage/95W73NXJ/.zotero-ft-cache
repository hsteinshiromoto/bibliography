Abstract
A suﬃcient condition for the stability of a system resulting from the interconnection of dynamical systems is given by the small gain theorem. Roughly speaking, to apply this theorem, it is required that the gains composition is continuous, increasing and upper bounded by the identity function. In this work, an alternative suﬃcient condition is presented for the case in which this criterion fails due to either lack of continuity or the bound of the composed gain is larger than the identity function. More precisely, the local (resp. non-local) asymptotic stability of the origin (resp. global attractivity of a compact set) is ensured by a region-dependent small gain condition. Under an additional condition that implies convergence of solutions for almost all initial conditions in a suitable domain, the almost global asymptotic stability of the origin is ensured. Two examples illustrate and motivate this approach.

1 Introduction
The use of nonlinear input-output gains for stability analysis was introduced in [26] by considering a system as an input-output operator. The condition that ensures stability, called Small Gain Theorem, of interconnected systems is based on the contraction principle.
The work [22] introduces a new concept of gain relating the input to system states. This notion of stability links Zames’ and Lyapunov’s approaches [23]. Characterizations in terms of dissipation and Lyapunov functions are given in [24].
In [14], the contraction principle is used in the input-to-state stability notion to obtain an equivalent Small Gain Theorem. A formulation of this criterion in terms of Lyapunov functions may be found in [13].
Besides stability analysis, the Small Gain Theorem may also be used for the design of dynamic feedback laws satisfying robustness constraints. The interested reader is invited to see [9, 21] and references therein. Other versions of the Small Gain theorem do exist in the literature, see [4, 5, 11, 12] for not necessarily ISS systems.
In order to apply the Small Gain Theorem, it is required that the composition of the nonlinear gains is smaller than the argument for all of its positive values. Such a condition, called Small Gain Condition, restricts the application of the Small Gain Theorem to a composition of well chosen gains.
In this work, an alternative criterion for the stabilization of interconnected systems is provided when a single Small Gain Condition does not hold globally. It consists in showing that if the two conditions hold: 1) a local (resp. non-local) Small Gain Condition holds in a local (resp. non-local) region of the state space, and the intersection of the local and non-local is empty, and 2) outside the union of these regions, the set of initial conditions from which the associated trajectories do not converge to the local region has measure zero, then the resulting interconnected system is almost asymptotically stable (this notion is precisely deﬁned below). In this paper, a suﬃcient condition guaranteeing this property to hold is presented. Moreover, for planar systems, an extension of the Bendixson’s criterion to regions which are not simply connected is given. This allows to obtain global asymptotic stability of the origin.
This approach may be seen as a uniﬁcation of two small gain conditions that hold in diﬀerent regions: a local and a non-local. The use of a unifying approach for local and non-local properties is well known in the literature see [2] in the context of control Lyapunov functions, see [6] when uniting iISS and ISS properties.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the system under con-

sideration and the problem statement are presented. Section 3 states the assumptions to solve the problem under consideration and the main results. Section 4 presents examples that illustrate the assumptions and main results. In Section 5 the proofs of the main results are presented. Section 6 collects some concluding remarks.
Notation. Let k ∈ Z>0. Let S be a subset of Rk containing the origin, the notation S=0 stands for S \ {0}. The closure of S is denoted by cl{S}. Let x ∈ Rk, the notation |x| stands for Euclidean norm of x. An open (resp. closed) ball centered at x ∈ Rk with radius r > 0 is denoted by B<r(x) (resp. B≤r(x)). A continuous function f : Rk → R is positive deﬁnite if, for every x ∈ Rk \ {0}, f (x) > 0 and f (0) = 0. It is proper if |f (x)| → ∞, as |x| → ∞. By L∞ loc(R, Rk) the class of functions η : R → Rk that are locally essentially bounded. By Cs
it is denoted the class of s-times continuously diﬀerentiable functions, by P it is
denoted the class of positive deﬁnite functions, by K it is denoted the class of
continuous, positive deﬁnite and strictly increasing functions γ : R≥0 → R≥0; it is denoted by K∞ if, in addition, they are unbounded. Let c ∈ R>0, the notation Ω⋄c(f ) stands for the subset of Rk deﬁned by {x ∈ Rk : f (x) ⋄ c}, where ⋄ is a comparison operator (i.e., =, <, ≥ etc). The support of the function f is the set supp := {x ∈ Rk : f (x) = 0}. By L∞ loc(R≥0, Rk) it is denoted the class of functions g : R≥0 → Rk that are locally essentially bounded. Let x, x¯ ∈ R≥0, the notation x ր x¯ (resp. x ց x¯) stands for x → x¯ with x < x¯ (resp. x > x¯).

2 Background and problem statement

Consider the system

x˙ (t) = f (x(t), u(t)),

(1)

where, for every t ∈ R≥0, x(t) ∈ Rn, and u ∈ L∞ loc(R≥0, Rm), for some positive integers n and m. Also, f ∈ C1(Rn+m, Rn). A solution of (1) with initial condition x, and input u at time t is denoted by X(t, x, u). From now on, arguments t will be omitted, and assume that the origin is input-tostable stable (ISS for short) for (1). For further details on this concept, the interested reader is invited to consult [23] or [25].
A locally Lipschitz function V : Rn → R≥0 for which there exist αx, αx ∈ K∞ such that, for every x ∈ Rn, αx(|x|) ≤ V (x) ≤ αx(|x|) is called storage function.
Inspired by [8, 16], the following notion of derivative will be used.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Consider the function ξ : [a, b) → R, the limit at t ∈ [a, b)

D+ξ(t)

=

lim

sup

ξ(t+τ )−ξ(t) τ

τ ց0

(if it exists) is called Dini derivative. Let k1 and k2 be positive integers, (y1, y2) ∈ Rk1 × Rk2, functions ϕ : Rk1+k2 → R, h1 : Rk1 → Rk1 and h2 :
Rk2 → Rk2. The limit

Dh+1,h2 ϕ(y1,

y2)

=

lim

sup

ϕ(y1+τ h1(y1),y2+τ h2(y2))−ϕ(y1,y2) τ

τ ց0

(if it exists) is called Dini derivative of ϕ in the h1 and h2-directions at

(y1, y2).1

◦

If, for a given storage function V , there exist a proper function λx ∈ (C0 ∩ P)(Rn, R≥0), and αx ∈ K∞ called ISS-Lyapunov gain such that, for every (x, u) ∈ Rn × Rm,

|x| ≥ αx(|u|) ⇒ Df+V (x, u) ≤ −λx(x),

(2)

then V is called ISS-Lyapunov function for (1). As in [8], the proof that

the existence of an ISS-Lyapunov implies that (1) is ISS goes along the lines

presented in [24].

Consider the system2

z˙ = g(v, z),

(3)

where v ∈ L∞ loc(R≥0, Rn), z ∈ Rm, and g ∈ C1(Rn+m, Rm). From now on, assume that W : Rn+m → R≥0 is an ISS-Lyapunov function for (3) with λz ∈ (C0 ∩ P)(Rm, R≥0), and αz ∈ K∞ satisfying, for every (v, z) ∈ Rn+m,

W (z) ≥ αz(|v|) ⇒ Dg+W (v, z) ≤ −λz(z).

(4)

System under consideration. Interconnecting systems (1) and (3)

yields the system

x˙ = f (x, z), z˙ = g(x, z).

(5)

Using the vectorial notation y = (x, z), system (5) is denoted by y˙ = h(y). A solution initiated from y in Rn+m and evaluated at time t is denoted Y (t, y).
The two ISS-Lyapunov inequalities (2) and (4) can be rephrased as follows. For every couple (x, z) ∈ Rn+m,

V (x) ≥ γ(W (z)) ⇒ Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x), W (z) ≥ δ(V (x)) ⇒ Dg+W (x, z) ≤ −λz(z)

(6)

1When the Dini derivative is taken in only one direction, the subscript denotes only
such a direction. 2A solution of (3) with initial condition z, and input v at time t is denoted by Z(t, z, v).

with suitable functions γ, δ ∈ K∞. A suﬃcient condition that ensures the stability of (5) is given by the
small gain theorem [13]. Roughly speaking if,

∀s ∈ R>0, γ ◦ δ(s) < s,

(7)

then the origin is globally asymptotically stable for (5). Problem statement. At this point, it is possible to explain the problem
under consideration. ISS systems for which (7) does not hold in a bounded set of R≥0 are considered. This paper shows that by merging small gain arguments in diﬀerent regions of the state space and employing some tools from measure theory, a suﬃcient condition ensuring almost global asymptotic stability of the origin is possible to be given. For planar interconnected systems, by using an extension of Bendixon’s criterion, global asymptotic stability of the origin may be established.

3 Assumptions and main results

Assumption 3.1. There exist constant values 0 ≤ M < M ≤ ∞ and
0 ≤ N < N ≤ ∞, and class K∞ functions γ and δ such that, for every (x, z) ∈ S ⊂ Rn × Rm, the implications

V (x) ≥ γ(W (z)) ⇒ Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x)

(8)

W (z) ≥ δ(V (x)) ⇒ Dg+W (x, z) ≤ −λz(z)

(9)

hold, where

S := {(x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm : M ≤ V (x) ≤ M ,

W (z) ≤ N } ∪ {(x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm :

(10)

V (x) ≤ M, N ≤ W (z) ≤ N },

◦

In other words, Assumption 3.1 states that the set Ω≤M (V ) × Ω≤N (W ) is locally ISS for the x and z-subsystems of (5). To see more details on locally ISS systems, the interested reader may consult [7].

Assumption 3.2.

if M < ∞, s ∈ [M , M] \ {0}, γ ◦ δ(s) < s, if M = ∞, s ∈ [M , M) \ {0}, γ ◦ δ(s) < s.

(11)

◦

Assumption 3.2 states that the small gain condition holds in the interval corresponding to the value of V , when x is restricted to S.

Proposition 3.3. Under Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2, if

M := max{γ−1(M), N } < min{δ(M ), N } =: M ,

(12)

then there exists a proper function U ∈ P(Rn+m, R≥0) that is locally Lipschitz on Rn+m \ {0} and such that,

∀y ∈ Ω≤M (U ) \ Ω≤M (U ),

lim sup U(Y (t, y)) ≤ M.
t→∞

Moreover, if γ, δ ∈ (C1 ∩ K∞), then a suitable U can be deﬁned, for every (x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm, by

U(x, z) = max

δ(V

(x))+γ−1 2

(13)

Condition (12) implies that Ω≤M (U ) Ω≤M (U ). Proposition 3.3 states that solutions of (5) starting in Ω≤M (U ) will converge to the set Ω≤M (U ). The proof of Proposition 3.3 is provided in Section 5.1.
Corollary 3.4. [Local stabilization] Consider Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 with the constant values M = N = 0, Mℓ := M < ∞ or Nℓ := N < ∞. The set Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ) is included in the basin of attraction of the origin of (5), where Uℓ and Mℓ are given by Proposition 3.3.
In other words, Corollary 3.4 states that the set Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ) is an estimation of the set of initial conditions from which issuing solution of (5) remain close and converge to the origin.
Before stating the second corollary, some concepts regarding the asymptotic behaviour of solutions are recalled. A set M ⊂ Rn+m is said to be positively invariant with respect to (5) if, for every t ∈ R≥0, y ∈ M ⇒ Y (t, y) ∈ M (cf. [15, p. 127]). A compact positively invariant set M ⊂ Rn+m is said to be globally attractive if, for all y ∈ Rn+m, limt→∞ |Y (t, y)|M = 0.
Corollary 3.5. [Global attractivity] Consider Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 with the constant values Mg := M > 0 or Ng := N > 0, and M = N = ∞. The set Ω≤Mg (Ug) is globally attractive for (5), where Ug and Mg are given by Proposition 3.3.

In other words, Corollary 3.5 states that the set Ω≤Mg (Ug) is an estimation of the global attractor of (5).
The proofs of Corollaries 3.4 and 3.5 are not provided and follow from Proposition 3.3. The interested reader may also consult [8, 7].
Under the assumptions of Corollaries 3.4 and 3.5, if the estimation of the global attractor Ω≤Mg (Ug) is contained in the estimation of the basin of attraction Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ), then global asymptotic stability of the origin for (5) follows trivially. However, when this inclusion does not hold, the set R = Ω≤Mg (Ug) \ Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ) is not empty, and solutions of (5) may converge to positively invariant sets contained in R instead (cf. Birkhoﬀ’s Theorem [10]). Figure 1 illustrates the region R obtained in this situation.
The next result provides suﬃcient conditions ensuring that, for almost every initial condition, issuing solutions remain close and converge to the origin. For the case in which (5) is planar, global asymptotic stability of the origin is established.
Before stating the main results, the concept of stability introduced in [3] is presented. The origin is called almost globally asymptotically stable for (5) if it is locally stable in the Lyapunov sense and attractive for almost every initial condition. More precisely, there exists ℵ ⊂ Rn+m, with µ(ℵ) = 0 such that, for every y ∈ Rn+m \ ℵ, limt→∞ |Y (t, y)| = 0, where µ is the Lebesgue measure.
Theorem 3.6. Under Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2, if the constant values of Corollaries 3.4 and 3.5 are such that Mℓ < Mg or Nℓ < Ng, there exists a function ρ ∈ C1(Rn+m \ {0}, R≥0) with supp(ρ) ⊇ R, where R = cl{Ω≤Mg (Ug) \ Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ)}, and if for every y ∈ R, div(hρ)(y) > 0, then the

origin is almost globally asymptotically stable for (5).
In other words, Theorem 1 states that with an extra assumption on the vector ﬁeld of system (4), solutions converge to the origin for almost every initial condition and the origin is locally asymptotically stable. The proof of Theorem 3.6 is provided in Section 5.2.
Theorem 3.7. Let n = m = 1. Under Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2, if the constant values of Corollaries 3.4 and 3.5 are such that Mℓ < Mg or Nℓ < Ng, and for every y ∈ R = cl{Ω≤Mg (Ug)\Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ)}, div h(y) = 0 and h(y) = 0, then the origin is globally asymptotically stable for (5).
Theorem 3.7 states that, when (5) is planar and under mild conditions on the vector ﬁeld, the origin is globally asymptotically stable for (5). In other words, no ω-limit sets exist in R. The proof of Theorem 3.7 is provided in Section 5.3.

4 Illustration
Here, the results given in the previous section are illustrated in two examples. The ﬁrst concerns the vectorial case, while the second concerns the planar case.

4.1 A class of systems satisfying an asymptotic smallgain condition

Recall system (5), and assume that there exist locally Lipschitz and proper

functions V ∈ P(Rn, R≥0) and W ∈ P(Rm, R≥0) satisfying3, for every (x, z) ∈

Rn × Rm,

Df+V (x, z) ≤ −V (x) + γ(W (z)), Dg+W (x, z) ≤ −W (z) + δ(V (x)),

(14)

where γ, δ ∈ K∞ are such that4

lim
s→0

γ

◦ δ(s) s

<

1

and

lim
s→∞

γ

◦ δ(s) s

<

1.

(15)

In other words, the composition γ ◦ δ satisﬁes the small-gain condition in the bi-limit: 0 and ∞. Note that to apply [5] it would be necessary to impose that, for every b1, b2 ∈ R≥0, and for some ε > 0, γ(b1)δ(b2) ≤ (1 − ε)b1b2.

3From Remark 2.4 of [24] Eq. (14) is equivalent to (6). 4Note that, in contrast to [5, 11, 12], no information is given about the behaviour of
the function s → γ ◦ δ(s), in the interval (0, ∞).

From (15), there exists a positive constant Mℓ (resp. Mg) that is sufﬁciently small (resp. large) and such that, for every s ∈ (0, Mℓ] (resp. s ∈ [Mg, ∞)), γ ◦ δ(s) < s. Together with (14) and since W is continuous and proper, Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 hold locally on the compact set
Ω≤Mℓ (V ) × Ω≤Nℓ(W ) (resp. non-locally on the set Ω≥Mg (V ) × Ω≥Ng (W )). Since condition Eq. (12) is satisﬁed, as formulated in Corollary 3.4 (resp.
3.5), from this result the set Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ) ⊂ Rn+m (resp. Ω≤Mg (Ug) ⊂ Rn+m) is an estimation of the basin of attraction of the origin (resp. global attractor)
of (17). Also, Ω≤Mℓ (Uℓ) ⊂ Ω≤Mg (Ug). Let5 rV (x, z) := −V (x) + γ(W (z)), rW (x, z) := −W (z) + δ(V (x)).
For any (x, z) belonging to the sets Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ) and Ω≥Mg (Ug) ⊂ Rn+m either 1. rV (x, z) ≥ 0 and rW (x, z) ≤ 0 or; 2. rV (x, z) ≤ 0 and rW (x, z) ≥ 0 or; 3. rV (x, z) ≤ 0 and rW (x, z) ≤ 0. While in the compact set R = Ω≤Mg (Ug) \ Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ), it may happen that rV (x, z) ≥ 0 and rV (x, z) ≥ 0. In this case, the result given in [4] can not be applied, because it requires that the union of the regions described by items 1-3 forms a cover of Rn+m.
Note that in contrast to [11], the existence of a Lyapunov function candidate for the system (5) whose derivative is deﬁnite negative on Rn+m is not
requested. Let, for every (x, y) ∈ Rn+m, ρ(x, y) = (V (x)+W (z))−1, and assume that
for every (x, z) ∈ R,

(div h(x, z))(V (x) + W (z)) ≥ γ(W (z)) + δ(V (x)).

(16)

In such a compact set, note that

div(hρ)(x, z) = ρ(x, z) div h(x, z) + grad ρ(x, z) · h(x, z)

where the ﬁrst inequality is due to (14): for every (x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm,

−Df+V (x, z) − Dg+W (x, z) ≥ V (x) − γ(W (z)) +W (z) − δ(V (x)),

5Note that, in contrast to [4], here it is not assumed that Ω≥Mg (Ug) ∪ Ω≤Mℓ (Uℓ) = Rn+m.

and last inequality is due to (16). From Theorem 3.6, the origin is almost globally asymptotically stable for
the system (5), as stated below.
Proposition 4.1. Assume that there exist ISS-Lyapunov functions for the sub-systems of (5) with ISS-Lyapunov gains satisfying (15), assume moreover that (16) holds, then the origin is almost globally asymptotically stable for system (5).

4.2 The planar case

Consider the system

x˙ = f (x, z) = −1.5x + 2p(z), z˙ = g(x, z) = −z + sin(x2/10),

(17)

where, for every s ∈ R, p(s) := s3/3 − 3s2/2 + 2s. Let, for every x ∈ R (resp. z ∈ R), V (x) = |x| (resp. W (z) = |z|).
Taking its Lie derivative in the f -direction yields, for every (x, z) ∈ R2,

Df+V (x, z) ≤ −1.5V (x) + 2|p(W (z))|.

(18)

Deﬁne, for every s ∈ R≥0, γ(s) = max{1.3|p(r)| : 0 ≤ r ≤ s}. From (18),

V (x) ≥ γ(W (z)) ⇒ Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x)

(19)

holds with a suitable λx ∈ (C0 ∩ P)(R, R≥0). The Lie derivative of W in the g-direction yields, for every (x, z) ∈ R2,

Dg+W (x, z) ≤ −W (z) + sin

V (x)2 10

.

which can be rephrased as follows

W (z) ≥ δ(V (x)) ⇒ Dg+W (x, z) ≤ −λz(z)
with a suitable λz ∈ (C0 ∩ P)(R, R≥0), where δ(s) = max{| sin(r2/10)| : 0 ≤ r ≤ s}.
The composition of the function γ and δ yields

γ ◦ δ(s) = max 1.3|p(r)| : 0 ≤ r ≤ max 0≤a≤s

sin

.

Note that there exist values s¯ > 0 for which γ ◦ δ(s¯) = 1.11. Also,

lim
s→0

γ◦δ(s) s

and

lim
s→∞

γ◦δ(s) s

(20)

From (20), and following the reasoning of the previous example, there
exists Mℓ > 0 small (resp. Mg > 0 large) enough such that, for every s ∈ (0, Mℓ] (resp. s ∈ [Mg, ∞)), γ ◦δ(s) < s. Also, there exist6 γℓ, δℓ ∈ K∞ (resp.7 γg ∈ K and δg ∈ K∞) satisfying, for every s ∈ [0, Mℓ] (resp. s ∈ [Mg, ∞)), γℓ(s) = γ(s) and γℓ(s) = γ(s) (resp. γg(s) = γ(s) and δg(s) = δ(s)). Thus,
analogously to the reasoning of the previous example, Assumptions 3.1 and
3.2 hold locally on the compact set Ω≤Mℓ(V ) × Ω≤Nℓ(W ) (resp. non-locally on the set Ω≥Mg (V ) × Ω≥Ng (W )).
Since condition Eq. (12) is satisﬁed, as formulated in Corollary 3.4 (resp. 3.5), from this result the set Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ) ⊂ Rn+m (resp. Ω≤Mg (Ug) ⊂ Rn+m) is estimation of the basin of attraction of the origin (resp. global attractor) of
(17). Also, Ω≤Mℓ (Uℓ) ⊂ Ω≤Mg (Ug). It now remains to check whether there exist ω-limit sets in R = Ω≤Mg (Ug)\
Ω≤Mℓ (Uℓ). Since

∂f ∂x

and

f (x, z) = 0 = g(x, z) ⇔ (x, z) = (0, 0),

from Theorem 3.7 the origin is globally asymptotically stable for (17).

5 Proofs

5.1 Proof of Proposition 3.3

Proof. The proof of Proposition 3.3 is based on the proof of [13, Theorem 3.1]. Here, it is divided into 3 parts. Firstly, the function σ ∈ K∞ ∩ C1 is obtained.
In the second part, the Dini derivative of a locally Lipschitz and proper function U ∈ P(Rn+m, R≥0) is shown to be decreasing in the set S deﬁned
in (10). In the third part, solutions of (5) starting in Ω≤M (U) \ Ω≤M (U) are shown to converge to Ω≤M (U ).
First Part. Under Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2, the function γ being of class K∞ satisﬁes, for every s ∈ R>0, δ(s) < γ−1(s). Together with the fact that δ is of class K∞, from [13, Lemma A.1], there exists σ ∈ K∞ ∩ C1 whose
derivative is strictly positive and satisﬁes,

∀s ∈ R>0, δ(s) < σ(s) < γ−1(s).

(21)

6Recall that γ and δ are continuous positive deﬁnite functions. Thus, they are strictly
increasing in a neighbourhood of the origin. Note also that γ is proper. 7Although γg is of class K, the result of Proposition 3.3 is still applicable. The main
diﬀerence in this case would be the construction of the function σ ∈ C1 ∩ K∞ satisfying
(21). The interested reader may consult [13] to check how this is done.

Second Part. Deﬁne, for every (x, z) ∈ Rn×Rm, U(x, z) = max{σ(V (x)), W (z)}.

Note that U ∈ (C0 ∩ P)(Rn+m, R≥0) is a proper function. Pick (x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm, one of three cases is possible: σ(V (x)) < W (z), W (z) < σ(V (x))

or W (z) = σ(V (x)). The proof follows by showing that the Dini derivative of

U is negative deﬁnite. For each case, assume that (x, z) ∈ S=0 := S\{(0, 0)},

where S is deﬁned in (10).

Case 1. Assume that σ(V (x)) < W (z). This implies that U(x, z) = W (z) and Df+,gU (x, z) = Dg+W (x, z). From (21), δ(V (x)) < σ(V (x)) < W (z). Since (x, z) ∈ S=0, the inequality Dg+W (x, z) ≤ −λz(z) follows from (9). Thus, W (z) > σ(V (x)) ⇒ Df+,gU (x, z) ≤ −λz(z).
Case 2. Assume that W (z) < σ(V (x)). This implies that U(x, z) = σ(V (x)) and Df+,gU (x, z) = σ′(V (x))Df+V (x, z). Since (x, z) ∈ S=0, and from (21),

W (z) < σ(V (x)) < γ−1(V (x)).

(22)

From (8), the inequality Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x) holds. Case 3. Assume that W (z) = σ(V (x)). Let U∗(x, z) := W (z) = σ(V (x)).

= max{σ′(V (x))Df+V (x, z), Dg+W (x, z)}.

The analysis of Df+,gU ∗ is divided in two sub cases. In the ﬁrst one, the function Dg+W is analyzed while in the last the function Df+V is analyzed.
Case 3.a. The analysis of Dg+W . From (21), and the fact that x = 0 and z = 0, the inequality δ(V (x)) < σ(V (x)) = W (z) holds. Moreover since
(x, z) ∈ S=0, the inequality Dg+W (x, z) ≤ −λz(z) follows from (9). Case 3.b. The analysis of Df+V . From (21), and the fact that x = 0 and
z = 0, the inequality W (z) = σ(V (x)) < γ−1(V (x)) holds. Moreover, since (x, z) ∈ S=0, the inequality Df+V (x, z) ≤ −λx(x) follows from (8).
Summing up Case 3, 0 = W (z) = σ(V (x)) ⇒ Df+,gU ∗(x, z) ≤ − min{σ′(V (x))λx(x), λz(z)}.

Claim 5.1. There exists c > 0 such that Ω≤c(U ) ⊂ Ω≤M (V ) × Ω≤N (W ). Moreover, the constants M and M are such that

(Ω≤M (V ) × Ω≤N (W )) ⊂ Ω≤M (U ) ⊂ Ω≤M (U )

(23)

⊂ (Ω≤M (V ) × Ω≤N (W )).

The proof of Claim 5.1 is provided in Section 5.4. From the above case study and (23),

M ≤ U (x, z) ≤ M ⇒ Df+,gU (x, z) ≤ −E(x, z),

(24)

where E ∈ (C0∩P)(Rn+m, R) is the proper function deﬁned, for every (x, z) ∈ Rn × Rm, by E(x, z) = min{σ′(V (x))λx(x), λz(z)}.
Third part. The local Lipschitz property of U on Rn × Rm \ {(0, 0)}
is due to the fact that σ(V (·)) (resp. W (·)) is locally Lipschitz on Rn \ {0}
(resp. Rm).
From [20, Theorem 4.3] and (24), for all (x, z) ∈ Rn ×Rm, and all t ∈ R≥0, along solutions of (5), D+U (X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x)) = Df+,gU (X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x)).
Since solutions of (5) are absolutely continuous functions and the right-

hand side of E is a continuous and positive deﬁnite function, from [20, Re-

mark 4.4.b], for every (x, z) such that M ≤ U(x, z) ≤ M, and all t ∈ R≥0, the function

t → U(X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x))

(25)

is strictly decreasing and satisﬁes

U∞ := lim U(X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x)) ≤ M . t→∞

To see this claim suppose, for purposes of contradiction, that U∞ > M . From the continuity of U, there exists ε > 0 such that U∞ − ε > M and U∞ − ε ≤ U(x, z) ≤ U∞ + ε. Since U is proper, the constant ξ = min{E(x, z) > 0 : U∞ −ε ≤ U(x, z) ≤ U∞ +ε} exists. Recalling the deﬁnition of U, there exists T > 0 such that, for all t ≥ T , U(X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x)) − U∞ < ε. Moreover,
from the deﬁnition of the constant ξ,

Then,

U(X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x)) − U(X(T, x, z), Z(T, z, x)) =
t
D+U(X(s, x, z), Z(s, z, x)) ds ≤ −ξ(t − T ).
T

U∞ = lim U(X(t, x, z), Z(t, z, x)) t→∞
= U(X(T, x, z), Z(T, z, x))
t
+ lim D+U(X(s, x, z), Z(s, z, x)) ds ≤ −∞ t→∞ T

which contradicts the fact that U is positive deﬁnite. Thus, U∞ ≤ M. Hence, solutions of (5) starting in Ω≤M (U ) \ Ω≤M (U ) converge towards Ω≤M (U ).

To see that U can be given by (13), note that U relies on the computation of σ. Let, for every s ∈ R≥0, σ(s) = (δ(s) + γ−1(s))/2. Its derivative yields, for every s > 0, 2σ′(s) = δ′(s) + 1/(γ′ ◦ γ(s)) which is positive, because8 δ′(s) > 0 and γ′ ◦ γ−1(s) > 0. Moreover, such a function σ satisﬁes (21). This concludes the proof.
5.2 Proof of Theorem 3.6
This proof is divided into 4 parts. The ﬁrst one shows that solutions starting in Ω≥Mg (Ug) converge to R. The second part shows that almost all solutions starting in R converges to Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ). The third part shows that solutions starting in the latter set converge to the origin. The fourth part concludes the almost global asymptotic stability of the origin.
1st part. From Corollary 3.5, the set Ω≤Mg (Ug) is globally attractive for (5), where Mg = max{γg−1(Mg), Ng}, Mg and Ng are deﬁned in Corollary 3.5, and γg is given by Assumption 3.1.
2nd part. From the proof of Proposition 3.3, there exist proper functions Ug, Eg ∈ (C0 ∩ P)(Rn+m, R≥0) (resp. Uℓ, Eℓ ∈ (C0 ∩ P)(Rn+m, R≥0)) with Ug (resp. Uℓ) being also locally Lipschitz and such that, for every y ∈ Ω≥Mg (Ug), Dh+Ug(y) ≤ −Eg(y) (resp. for every y ∈ Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ), Dh+Uℓ(y) ≤ −Eℓ(y)).
To see that Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ) Ω≤Mg (Ug). From the proof of Claim 5.1, Uℓ(x, z) ≤ Mℓ ⇒ max{V (x), W (z)} ≤ min{Mℓ, Nℓ}. Analogously, Ug(x, z) ≥ Mg ⇒ min{V (x), W (z)} ≥ max{Mg, Ng}. Since min{Mℓ, Nℓ} < max{Mg, Ng}, Ω≤Mℓ (Uℓ) Ω≤Mg (Ug).
The proof proceeds by showing that, for almost every initial condition staring in R = Ω≤Mg (Ug) \ Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ), issuing solutions of (5) converge to Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ). To do so, the same lines as in [19, Theorem 1] and [3, Theorem 3] are followed. However, here a less conservative condition is required, since a set that is only positively invariant, and the divergence to be positive only in a compact set are needed.
Let Z ⊂ Rn a set given by9
∞
Z = {y ∈ Ω≤Mg (Ug) : Uℓ(Y (t, y)) > Mℓ, t > l}.
l=1
For every t ∈ R, let Y (t, Z) = {Y (t, z) : z ∈ Z, t ∈ dom(z)}, where dom(z) is the maximum time interval where Y (t, z) exists. Since Ω≤Mg (Ug)
8Recall that δ, γ ∈ (C1 ∩ K∞). 9Note that Z is the set of all initial conditions belonging to Ω≤Mg (Ug) from which issuing solutions do not converge to Ω≤Mℓ (Uℓ).

is positively invariant, Z is also positively invariant. Thus, given a ﬁxed τ ∈ R>0, for all t ≥ τ , Y (t, Z) ⊂ Y (τ, Z). Hence, for all t ∈ R≥0,

Y (t,Z) ρ(y) dy − Z ρ(y) dy ≤ 0,

(26)

where ρ ∈ C1(Rn+m \ {0}, R≥0) and supp(ρ) ⊇ R. From Liouville’s Theorem (see [19, Lemma A.1]), for every t ∈ R≥0,

t 0

Y (s,Z) div(hρ)(y) dyds =

Y (t,Z) ρ(y) dy −

Z ρ(y) dy.

Since Z ⊂ R, for every t ∈ R≥0, the inequality

t div(hρ)(y) dy ≤
Y (t,Z)
≤

t 0

Y (s,Z) div(hρ)(y) dyds

Y (t,Z) ρ(y) dy − Z ρ(y) dy

holds. From (26), for every t ∈ R≥0, Y (t,Z) div(hρ)(y) dy ≤ 0. Together with the fact that, for every y ∈ R, div(hρ)(y) > 0, it yields Y (t,Z) div(hρ)(y) dy = 0, for every t ∈ R≥0. Thus, for every t ∈ R≥0, Y (t, Z) has Lebesgue measure zero. In particular, Z has also Lebesgue measure zero. Consequently, for
almost every y ∈ R, lim supt→∞ Uℓ(Y (t, y)) ≤ Mℓ. It remains to check if the initial conditions belonging to Ω≥Mg (Ug) from
which issuing solutions converge to Z have also measure zero. Since Z is
positively invariant, for all t1 < t2 ≤ 0, Y (t2, Z) ⊂ Y (t1, Z). This inclusion implies that Y := ∪t≤0{Y (t, Z)} = ∪l∈Z<0 {Y (l, Z)}. Hence, the set Y is a countable union of images of Z by the ﬂow. Since Z is measurable and, for every t ∈ dom(y), the map Z ∋ y → Y (t, y) is a diﬀeomorphism10, Y is also
measurable.
For every t ∈ dom(Z), Y (t,Z) dz ≤ Z | grad Y (t, y)| dy = 0, because Z has measure zero. This implies that, for all t ∈ dom(Z), the set Y (t, Z) has
measure zero. Since Y is the countable union of sets of measure zero, it has also measure zero.11 Hence the set of solutions starting in Ω≥Mg (Ug) that converge to Z have also measure zero.
3rd part. From Corollary 3.4, the set Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ) is contained in the
basin of attraction of the origin, where Mℓ = min{δℓ(Mℓ), Nℓ}, Mℓ and Nℓ are deﬁned in Corollary 3.4, and γℓ is given by Assumption 3.1.
4th part. From the above discussion, the origin is locally stable and
almost globally attractive for (5). Thus, it is almost globally asymptotically
stable for (5). This concludes the proof.

10Because (5) is of class C1 and solutions are unique. 11Recall that Y is the set of initial conditions from which issuing solutions of (5) converge
Z.

5.3 Proof of Theorem 3.7

Before proving Theorem 3.7, some concepts regarding the asymptotic behavior of solutions of planar systems are recalled. A point p is said to be a positive limit point of Y (·, y) if there exists a sequence {tn}n∈N, with tn → ∞ as n → ∞, such that Y (tn, y) → p as n → ∞ (cf. [15, p. 127]). The set ω(y) of all positive limit points of Y (·, y) is called ω-limit set of y (cf. [10, p. 517]). For planar systems, a closed curve C ⊂ R2 is called closed orbit if C is not an equilibrium point and there exists a time T < ∞ such that, for each y ∈ C, Y (nT, y) = y, ∀n ∈ Z (cf. [21, Deﬁnition 2.6]).

Proof. The proof of Theorem 3.7 follows the same line as the proof of Theo-
rem 3.6. The diﬀerence here consists in the second and fourth parts.
1st part. Recall that from Corollary 3.5, the set Ω≤Mg (Ug) is globally
attractive for (5), where Mg = max{γg−1(Mg), Ng}, Mg and Ng are deﬁned in Corollary 3.5, and γg is given by Assumption 3.1.
2nd part (Bendixson’s criterion for non simply connected regions). From the proof of Proposition 3.3, there exist proper functions Ug, Eg ∈ (C0 ∩ P)(R2, R≥0) (resp. Uℓ, Eℓ ∈ (C0 ∩ P)(R2, R≥0)) with Ug (resp. Uℓ) being also locally Lipschitz and such that, for every y ∈ Ω≥Mg (Ug), Dh+Ug(y) ≤ −Eg(y) (resp. for every y ∈ Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ), Dh+Uℓ(y) ≤ −Eℓ(y)).
Since the set R = cl{Ω≤Mg (Ug) \ Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ)} is compact, and for each y ∈ R, Ug(y) = 0, from [1, Theorem 2.5]
• The set Ω=Mg (Ug) has ﬁnite perimeter; • The function Ug is almost every where diﬀerentiable on Ω=Mg (Ug); • Let Ng ⊂ Ω=Mg (Ug) be set in which Ug is not diﬀerentiable. There exists a Lipschitz parametrization pg : [ag, bg] ⊂ R → Ω=Mg (Ug) that is injective and satisﬁes, for almost every s ∈ [ag, bg], pg(s) ∈/ Ng and p′g(s) is perpendicular to ∇Ug(pg(s)).
Recall that by assumption, for every y ∈ R, h(y) = 0. Together with the fact that h ∈ C1(R2), and almost each sublevel set of Ug has ﬁnite perimeter.
From the generalized divergence theorem [17, Theorem 1.7] (see also [18])

div h(y) dy = h(y) · ng(y) dxdz.

Ω≤Mg (Ug)

Ω=Mg (Ug )

(27)

Together with the above discussions and the existence of the parametrization pg, for almost every s ∈ [ag, bg], h(pg(s)) · ng(pg(s)) < 0, where for almost every s ∈ [ag, bg], ng(pg(s)) = ∇Ug(pg(s))/|∇Ug(pg(s))|,

div h(y) dy = h(pg(s)) · ng(pg(s)) ds < 0.

Ω≤Mg (Ug)

[ag ,bg ]

(28)

Analogously to the above, and by letting pℓ : [aℓ, bℓ] → Ω=Mℓ(Uℓ) be a parametrization of Ω=Mℓ(Uℓ) with outward unit normal nℓ, based on Equation (27),

div h(y) dy = h(pℓ(s)) · nℓ(pℓ(s)) ds < 0.

Ω≤Mℓ (Uℓ)

[aℓ ,bℓ ]

(29)

Suppose, for purposes of contradiction, that there exists a closed orbit C ∈ R2, parametrized by p : [a, b] → C and with outward unit normal n, and
contained in R. From the generalized divergence theorem,

div h(x, z) dxdz = h(p(s)) · n(p(s)) ds = 0,

(30)

DC

[a,b]

where DC is the simply connected region bounded by C. Note that,

div h(y) dy
Ω≤Mg (Ug )\DC

= div h(y) dy − div h(y) dy

Ω≤Mg (Ug)

DC

=

div h(y) dy,

Ω≤Mg (Ug )

where the last equality is due to (30). From (28),

div h(y) dy < 0.
Ω≤Mg (Ug)\DC

(31)

On the other hand,

div h(y) dy
DC \Ω≤Mℓ (Uℓ)

= div h(y) dy − div h(y) dy

DC
=−

Ω≤Mℓ (Uℓ)
div h(y) dy,

Ω≤Mℓ (Uℓ)

where the last equality is due to (30). From (29),

div h(x, z) dxdz > 0.
DC \Ω≤Mℓ (Uℓ)

(32)

From (31), (32) and the continuity of div h, the function div h changes sign in R. Thus, there exists y¯ ∈ R such that div h(y¯) = 0 which is a contradiction with the hypothesis div(y) = 0, for every y ∈ R. Thus, there exist no closed orbits C contained in R.
From the Poincar´e-Bendixson Theorem [21, Theorem 2.15], the ω-limit set of a solution starting in R is a closed orbit or equilibrium. Since equilibria

are impossible by assumption, and from above analysis there exist no ω-limit sets in R, all solutions starting in R will converge to Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ).
3rd part. Recall that from Corollary 3.4, the set Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ) is contained in the basin of attraction of the origin, where Mℓ = min{δℓ(Mℓ), Nℓ}, Mℓ and Nℓ are deﬁned in Corollary 3.4, and γℓ is given by Assumption 3.1.
4th part. From the above discussion, the origin is locally stable and globally attractive for (5). Thus, it is globally asymptotically stable for (5). This concludes the proof.

Remark 5.2. Note that, if Ω≤Mℓ(Uℓ) = {0}, then R = Ω≤Mg (Ug) is a simply connected region, and the second part of the proof of Theorem 3.7 can be

reduced to the proof of the known Bendixson’s criterion.

5.4 Proof of Claim 5.1
Let c be a positive real number12 such that Ω≤c(U ) ⊂ Ω≤M (V ) × Ω≤N (W ). In the ﬁrst part, it will be shown that, for all (x, z) ∈ S,

U(x, z) ≤ M ⇒ max{V (x), W (z)} ≤ min{M, N}.

(33)

In the second part, it will be shown that, for all (x, z) ∈ S,

M ≤ U(x, z) ⇒ max{M, N } ≤ min{V (x), W (z)}.

(34)

Part 1. U(x, z) ≤ M. This implies U(x, z) =
max{σ(V (x)), W (z)} ≤ M = min{δ(M), N}. Assume that max{σ(V (x)), W (z)} = σ(V (x)) and min{δ(M), N} = δ(M ).
This implies σ(V (x)) ≤ δ(M ). From (21), V (x) ≤ σ−1 ◦ δ(M) < M . Assume now that max{σ(V (x)), W (z)} = W (z) and min{δ(M), N} = δ(M ). This implies W (z) ≤ δ(M ) ≤ N . The other two cases are straightforward. Thus, (33) holds. Hence, Ω≤M (U ) ⊂ (Ω≤M (V ) × Ω≤N (W )); Part 2. M ≤ U(x, z). This implies M = max{γ−1(M ), N } ≤ U(x, z) = max{σ(V (x)), W (z)}.
Assume that, max{γ−1(M ), N } = γ−1(M ) and max{σ(V (x)), W (z)} = σ(V (x)). This implies γ−1(M ) ≤ σ(V (x)). From (21), M ≤ γ ◦ σ(V (x)) <
12Such a positive real number always exist. Otherwise, for all n ≥ N, there exists yn such that yn ∈ Ω≤1/n(U ) and yn ∈/ Ω≤M (V ) × Ω≤N (W ). Since U is proper, Ω≤1/n(U ) ⊂ Ω≤1(U ) is compact. Hence, there exists {ynj }j∈N ⊂ {yn}n∈N such that ynj −j−→−∞→ y∗ and U (y∗) = 0. From the positive deﬁniteness of U , y∗ = 0. Consequently, ynj is a sequence converging to zero and outside Ω≤M (V ) × Ω≤N (W ). This is impossible since this set is a neighborhood of the origin.

V (x). Assume now that, max{γ−1(M), N } = γ−1(M ) and max{σ(V (x)), W (z)} = W (z). This implies N ≤ γ−1(M ) ≤ W (z). The other two cases are straightforward. Thus, (34) holds. Hence, (Ω≤M (V ) × Ω≤N (W )) ⊂ Ω≤M (U );
Since (12) is a strict inequality, from the continuity and surjectivity of U, there exists (x, z) ∈ S such that M ≤ U(x, z) ≤ M . From (33) and (34), M ≤ U(x, z) ≤ M ⇒ max{M , N} ≤ min{V (x), W (z)} ≤ max{V (x), W (z)} ≤ min{M , N}. Thus, the inclusion (23) holds. This concludes the proof.
6 Conclusion
Systems for which the small gain theorem cannot be used, a suﬃcient condition for the stability of the resulting interconnected system is proposed. The approach consists in verifying if the small gain condition holds in two diﬀerent regions of the state space: a local and a non-local. In the gap between both regions, assuming mild properties on the vector ﬁeld, a suﬃcient condition ensuring the convergence of solutions, for almost every initial condition, is provided. An approach is proposed for planar system for which Bendixson’s criterion does not hold. Two examples illustrate the results.
The authors plan to extend the proposed approach for the case in which, in a countable number of intervals, the small gain condition holds and, between such intervals, a condition ensuring the absence of ω-limit set holds.
