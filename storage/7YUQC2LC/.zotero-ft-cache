    Abstract: In this paper, the problem of stability analysis of a large-scale interconnection of nonlinear systems for which the small-gain condition does not hold globally is considered. A combination of the small-gain and density propagation inequalities is employed to prove almost input-to-state stability of the network. 

Comments: 	This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due the fact that the main results Proposition 4.1 and Theorem 4.8 are not correct. Anonymous reviewers notice, that In the former the set B\A is not necessarily nonempty while, in the latter, the formulation and proof are unclear
